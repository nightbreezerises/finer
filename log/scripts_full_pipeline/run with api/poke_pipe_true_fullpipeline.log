Your task is to tell me what are the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.

Specifically, you can complete the task by following the instructions below:
1 - I give you an example delimited by <> about what are the useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in 
a photo of a bird. You should understand and learn this example carefully.
2 - List the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.
3 - Output a Python list object that contains the listed useful attributes.

Your task is to tell me what are the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.

Specifically, you can complete the task by following the instructions below:
1 - I give you an example delimited by <> about what are the useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in 
a photo of a bird. You should understand and learn this example carefully.
2 - List the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.
3 - Output a Python list object that contains the listed useful attributes.

===
<bird species>
The useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in a photo of a bird:
['bill shape', 'wing color', 'upperparts color', 'underparts color', 'breast pattern',
'back color', 'tail shape', 'upper tail color', 'head pattern', 'breast color',
'throat color', 'eye color', 'bill length', 'forehead color', 'under tail color',
'nape color', 'belly color', 'wing shape', 'size', 'shape',
'back pattern', 'tail pattern', 'belly pattern', 'primary color', 'leg color',
'bill color', 'crown color', 'wing pattern', 'habitat']

====================
The useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon could include:

- Type (e.g., fire, water, grass)
- Color
- Body shape
- Eye shape
- Tail shape
- Special features (e.g., horns, spikes)
- Size
- Markings or patterns
- Facial features
- Number of limbs
- Special abilities

Here is a Python list object containing the listed useful attributes:

```python
pokemon_attributes = ['Type', 'Color', 'Body shape', 'Eye shape', 'Tail shape', 'Special features', 'Size', 'Markings or patterns', 'Facial features', 'Number of limbs', 'Special abilities']
print(pokemon_attributes)

Your task is to tell me what are the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.

Specifically, you can complete the task by following the instructions below:
1 - I give you an example delimited by <> about what are the useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in 
a photo of a bird. You should understand and learn this example carefully.
2 - List the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.
3 - Output a Python list object that contains the listed useful attributes.

===
<bird species>
The useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in a photo of a bird:
['bill shape', 'wing color', 'upperparts color', 'underparts color', 'breast pattern',
'back color', 'tail shape', 'upper tail color', 'head pattern', 'breast color',
'throat color', 'eye color', 'bill length', 'forehead color', 'under tail color',
'nape color', 'belly color', 'wing shape', 'size', 'shape',
'back pattern', 'tail pattern', 'belly pattern', 'primary color', 'leg color',
'bill color', 'crown color', 'wing pattern', 'habitat']
===

===
<pokemon names>
The useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon:
===

====================
The useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon could include:

- Type (e.g., fire, water, grass)
- Color
- Body shape
- Tail shape
- Eye shape/color
- Special features (e.g., horns, wings)
- Size
- Markings/patterns
- Abilities
- Evolution stage

Here is a Python list object containing the listed useful attributes:

```python
pokemon_attributes = ['Type', 'Color', 'Body shape', 'Tail shape', 'Eye shape/color', 'Special features', 'Size', 'Markings/patterns', 'Abilities', 'Evolution stage']
print(pokemon_attributes)
```

Your task is to tell me what are the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.

Specifically, you can complete the task by following the instructions below:
1 - I give you an example delimited by <> about what are the useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in 
a photo of a bird. You should understand and learn this example carefully.
2 - List the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.
3 - Output a Python list object that contains the listed useful attributes.

===
<bird species>
The useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in a photo of a bird:
['bill shape', 'wing color', 'upperparts color', 'underparts color', 'breast pattern',
'back color', 'tail shape', 'upper tail color', 'head pattern', 'breast color',
'throat color', 'eye color', 'bill length', 'forehead color', 'under tail color',
'nape color', 'belly color', 'wing shape', 'size', 'shape',
'back pattern', 'tail pattern', 'belly pattern', 'primary color', 'leg color',
'bill color', 'crown color', 'wing pattern', 'habitat']

<pokemon names>
The useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon:
===

====================
The useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon could include:

1. Type (e.g., fire, water, grass)
2. Color
3. Body shape
4. Facial features
5. Tail shape
6. Size
7. Markings or patterns
8. Eye color
9. Special abilities
10. Evolution stage

Here is a Python list object containing the listed useful attributes:

```python
pokemon_attributes = ['Type', 'Color', 'Body shape', 'Facial features', 'Tail shape', 'Size', 'Markings or patterns', 'Eye color', 'Special abilities', 'Evolution stage']
print(pokemon_attributes)
```

Your task is to tell me what are the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.

Specifically, you can complete the task by following the instructions below:
1 - I give you an example delimited by <> about what are the useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in 
a photo of a bird. You should understand and learn this example carefully.
2 - List the useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon.
3 - Output a Python list object that contains the listed useful attributes.

===
<bird species>
The useful attributes for distinguishing bird species in a photo of a bird:
['bill shape', 'wing color', 'upperparts color', 'underparts color', 'breast pattern',
'back color', 'tail shape', 'upper tail color', 'head pattern', 'breast color',
'throat color', 'eye color', 'bill length', 'forehead color', 'under tail color',
'nape color', 'belly color', 'wing shape', 'size', 'shape',
'back pattern', 'tail pattern', 'belly pattern', 'primary color', 'leg color',
'bill color', 'crown color', 'wing pattern', 'habitat']

<pokemon names>
The useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon:
===

====================
The useful attributes for distinguishing pokemon names in a photo of a pokemon could include:

1. Coloration
2. Body shape
3. Eye color
4. Tail shape
5. Head shape
6. Markings or patterns
7. Size
8. Type-specific features (e.g., fire for fire-type pokemon, wings for flying-type pokemon)

Here is a Python list object containing the listed useful attributes:

```python
pokemon_attributes = ['coloration', 'body shape', 'eye color', 'tail shape', 'head shape', 'markings or patterns', 'size', 'type-specific features']
print(pokemon_attributes)
```
