        I have a image of a pokemon . 
        Your task is to perform the following actions:
        1 - Summarize the information you get about the pokemon in this image from the general description and 
        attribute descriptions delimited by triple backticks with five sentences.
        2 - Infer and list three possible names of the pokemon in this photo based on the 
        information you get.

        attribute descriptions delimited by triple backticks with five sentences.
        2 - Infer and list three possible names of the pokemon in this photo based on the 
        information you get.
        3 - Output a JSON object that uses the following format
        <three possible pokemon names>: [
                <first sentence of the summary>,
                <second sentence of the summary>,

        I have a image of a pokemon . 
        Your task is to perform the following actions:
        1 - Summarize the information you get about the pokemon in this image from the general description and 
        attribute descriptions delimited by triple backticks with five sentences.
        2 - Infer and list three possible names of the pokemon in this photo based on the 
        information you get.
