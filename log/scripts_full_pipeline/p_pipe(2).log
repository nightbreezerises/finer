            I have a photo of a cat. 
            Your task is to perform the following actions:
            1 - Summarize the information you get about the cat from the general description and attribute description             delimited by triple backticks with five sentences.
            2 - Infer and list three possible breed names of the cat in this photo based on the information you get.
            3 - Output a JSON object that uses the following format
            <three possible cat breeds>: [
                    <first sentence of the summary>,
                    <second sentence of the summary>,
                    <third sentence of the summary>,

            I have a photo of a dog. 
            Your task is to perform the following actions:
            1 - Summarize the information you get about the dog from the general description and attribute description             delimited by triple backticks with five sentences.
            2 - Infer and list three possible breed names of the dog in this photo based on the information you get.
            3 - Output a JSON object that uses the following format
            <three possible dog breeds>: [
                    <first sentence of the summary>,
